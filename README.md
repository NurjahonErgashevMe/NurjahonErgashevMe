🚀 With over 3 years of experience, I have honed my skills in building world-class, branded enterprise software products. My path involves using a variety of technologies to design, develop, and deploy enterprise-class solutions, while also gaining a deep understanding of customer needs and product usage.

👨‍🏭 Leading and mentoring teams, I set coding standards and UI best practices. My extensive application development experience ensures that I am always at the forefront of UI innovation.

🛠️ My tech toolkit includes NextJS, React, React Native, NodeJS, Redux/RTK Toolkit, GraphQL, Webpack, and TypeScript. I thrive in Agile environments, where I've spent more than 3 years crafting accessible UIs for web applications, emphasizing iterations, continuous integration, and unwavering quality.

🔐 Industry Authentication standards like oAuth2? Yep, I've got you covered. Incorporating Authorization aspects into the UI framework is just another day at the office for me.

🧠 When it comes to problem-solving, my Agile mindset shines through, adapting seamlessly to various methodologies. My knack for breaking down complex technical matters into clear, digestible explanations lets me bridge the gap between tech and business effortlessly.

Let's connect and build the future together! 🌟
